# Course Project: Enhancing "Vinho Verde" Wine Quality
### May 2023 â€“ June 2023
#### Group Assignment for DATA 2002: Data Analytics: Learning from Data
**Instructor:** Prof. Garth

## Overview
This project involved applying advanced statistical techniques to analyze and suggest improvements for the quality of "Vinho Verde" wine. Our approach combined various analytical methods to understand the dataset's structure and its predictive variables, focusing on how specific factors influence wine quality.

## Techniques Employed
- **Statistical Analysis:** 
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
  - Categorical Data Analysis
  - Linear Regression
  - Linear Model Selection and Regularization
- **Software & Tools:** Utilized leading statistical and data analysis software for managing and examining wine quality datasets.
- **Model Selection:** Applied both Forward and Backward Stepwise Regression, which interestingly resulted in identical Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values.
- **Residual Analysis:** Conducted to ensure the independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality in the data.

## Key Findings & Activities
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gained a deep understanding of the data structure and the predictive variables influencing wine quality.
- **Correlation Identification:** Discovered significant correlations between wine quality and factors such as acidity, sulphates, residual sugar, and sulfur dioxide levels.
- **Quality Improvement Strategies:** Proposed evidence-based strategies for wine producers aimed at enhancing the quality of their products.

## Contribution to the Wine Community
- Our findings and recommendations were presented at the **Wine Appreciation Conference**, providing valuable insights into how wine quality can be improved through analytical approaches.
